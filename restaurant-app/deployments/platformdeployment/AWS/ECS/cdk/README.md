This is a sample CDK program. This program does not accept inputs and it is somewhat opinionated in how it works. It creates a VPC, an ECS cluster and it deploys Yelb as a group of ECS services.

In order to use CDK make sure you have it properly [installed on your system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html) or use [eksutils](https://github.com/mreferre/eksutils).

Once you have the pre-requisite above, just launch:

```
npm install 
cdk deploy 
```
