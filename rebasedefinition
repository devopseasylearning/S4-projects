rebasing is a process of moving the commits of one branch onto the tip of another branch.
This means that instead of creating a new merge commit like git merge, git rebase rewrites the project history by creating new commits that apply the changes from one branch onto another.
It incorporating changes from one branch onto another. 
This is useful when you have two branches that have diverged and you want to bring the changes from one branch into another.
